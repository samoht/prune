Test empty record cleanup after all fields are removed
======================================================

This test verifies that when all fields are removed from a record type,
the empty record type is replaced with unit to avoid syntax errors.

Build shows warning 69 for both fields:
  $ dune build 2>&1 | grep -A1 "warning 69" | head -4
  Error (warning 69 [unused-field]): record field login_count is never read.
  (However, this field is used to build or mutate values.)
  --
  Error (warning 69 [unused-field]): record field last_login is never read.

Run prune with --force:
  $ prune clean . --force
